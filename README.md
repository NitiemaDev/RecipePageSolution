## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This was my first time using Tailwind CSS. I learned how to create responsive designs efficiently using its utility-first approach. I also deepened my understanding of the mobile-first design concept, which helped me ensure the page is optimized for smaller screens first, then progressively enhance it for larger ones.

I used the Tailwind CSS CDN for simplicity in this project:

```html
<!-- Tailwind CSS CDN -->
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```

### Continued Development

I plan to continue learning more about Tailwind CSS and experimenting with its advanced features, such as customizing themes and components.

### Useful Resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This resource helped me use Tailwind classes I wasnâ€™t familiar with.
